Welcome to Hesmapy's documentation!
===================================

Hesmapy is a Python package providing a set of tools to work with the data from the HESMA.
It introduces a new data sturcture for the HESMA data in an attempt to make the data more accessible and easier to work with.
For the more simple data, tools such as plotting are provided.
These utilities, however, are mostly intended for use by HESMA iself and might be rather limited in their functionality.
Moreover it provides loaders for the more complex data types such as raw binary data and HDF5 files.
